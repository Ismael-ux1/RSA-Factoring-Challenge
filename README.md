A Readme file for the project RSA Factoring Challenge

RSA Factoring Challenge
This repository contains a solution for the RSA Factoring Challenge, which aims to factorize numbers into a product of two smaller numbers. The goal is to implement an efficient algorithm to factorize a given set of natural numbers.

Challenge Description
The task is to factorize a set of natural numbers into a product of two smaller numbers. The input will be provided in a file, where each line contains a single number. The numbers are guaranteed to be valid natural numbers greater than 1.

The program should output the factorization results in the format n = p * q, where n is the input number and p and q are the two factors. Multiple factorizations should be printed on separate lines.

Requirements
To run the program, you will need:

Python 3.x (no external dependencies required)
Usage
1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rsa-factoring-challenge.git

2. Navigate to the repository's directory:
cd RSA Factoring Challenge

3. Create a text file containing the natural numbers to factorize, with each number on a separate line. Ensure that the file follows the specified format.

4. Run the program using the following command:
python factorize.py <filename>

5. The program will output the factorizations of the numbers to the console.

Performance Considerations
The provided implementation utilizes an efficient algorithm to factorize numbers. However, it's important to note that extremely large numbers may require more advanced algorithms, such as Pollard's Rho or the quadratic sieve, to factorize within a reasonable time frame. The current implementation should perform well for numbers within a typical range.
